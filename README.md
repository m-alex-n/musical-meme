I have implemented BigInt class that implements arbitrary-precision integers, allowing for operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and factorial. The class handles both positive and negative integers represented as lists of digits, ensuring that calculations can be performed regardless of the size of the numbers. Key methods include constructors for initializing values, operator overloads for arithmetic operations, and static helper methods for internal calculations on absolute values. Additionally, a repl function provides an interactive command-line interface for users to perform calculations with BigInt, supporting various mathematical expressions and error handling for invalid inputs.
